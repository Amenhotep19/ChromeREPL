# ChromeREPL

Thanks for installing ChromeREPL!

## Workflow

The basic workflow is (via the command palette)

- `ChromeREPL: Start Chrome` or `ChromeREPL: Restart Chrome`
- `ChromeREPL: Connect to Tab`
- Select the desired tab
- Open Chrome Devtools in the browser
- Execute code from Sublime!
    + MacOS: ctrl enter
    + Win/Linux: alt enter

## Settings

In Settings you can change the path to Chrome (in case you want to use Chromium or Canary).

There is also the option to focus the tab in Chrome when connecting.

### Linux Users

By default tab focusing is disabled in Linux as it relies on `wmctrl`, if you install this (e.g. via `apt-get`) you can enable this
