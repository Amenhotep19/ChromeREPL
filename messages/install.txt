# ChromeREPL

Thanks for installing ChromeREPL!

## ðŸš¨ Security ðŸš¨

When Chrome starts it will use a new Chrome user profile. This is because the Chrome DevTools protocol (that is used for communication) opens a port for communication, but also exposes your cookies. To prevent people on your network from sniffing your important cookies (e.g. website logins), a temporary Chrome user profile is used by default.

You *can choose* to use your default Chrome profile, but you should only do so if you are not connected to a network.

## Workflow

The basic workflow is (via the command palette: macOS: `cmd shift P`, win/lin: `ctrl shift P`)

- `ChromeREPL: Start Chrome` or `ChromeREPL: Restart Chrome`
- `ChromeREPL: Connect to Tab`
- Select the desired tab
- Open Chrome Devtools in the browser
- Execute code from Sublime!
    + MacOS: ctrl enter
    + Win/Linux: alt enter

## Settings

In Settings you can change the path to Chrome (in case you want to use Chromium or Canary).

There is also the option to focus the tab in Chrome when connecting.

### Linux Users

By default tab focusing is disabled in Linux as it relies on `wmctrl`, if you install this (e.g. via `apt-get`) you can enable this
