# Chrome REPL 1.4.0

## ðŸš¨ Security ðŸš¨

When Chrome starts it will use a new Chrome user profile. This is because the Chrome DevTools protocol (that is used for communication) opens a port for communication, but also exposes your cookies. To prevent people on your network from sniffing your important cookies (e.g. website logins), a temporary Chrome user profile is used by default.

You *can choose* to use your default Chrome profile, but you should only do so if you are not connected to a network.
