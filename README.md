# Chrome Console

A simple SublimeText 3 Plugin to remotely execute JavaScript code in Chrome, because typing in the console sucks.

Input and output are logged to the console.

## Thanks

The project was inspired by [SublimeWebInspector](https://github.com/sokolovstas/SublimeWebInspector/tree/master) but aims to be far less ambitious, and hopefully far easier to maintain.

Uses a *ever so slightly* modified version of [PyChromeDevTools](https://github.com/marty90/PyChromeDevTools)

All dependencies are included to make life easier: [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), [websocket-client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client) and [six](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six).
